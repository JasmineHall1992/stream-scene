- **Database & storage strategy**: MySQL with Sequelize ORM using TypeScript decorators, migrations via sequelize-cli, and AWS S3 for blob storage with presigned URLs
- **Authentication & authorization**: Passport.js with OAuth2 strategies (Google, Twitter), session management via express-session, and JWT tokens for API access
- **Development workflow**: Concurrent dev servers, TypeScript compilation with tsx/ts-node, ESLint + Prettier for code quality, and environment-based configuration

**Technical lingo to showcase:**
- "Implemented domain-driven design with Sequelize models and TypeScript interfaces"
- "Leveraged React's concurrent features and Suspense boundaries for optimal UX"
- "Used Webpack's dependency graph optimization and asset hashing for production caching"
- "Applied OAuth2 authorization code flow with PKCE for secure authentication"

**Follow-up answer**: "Which part of the stack did you own end-to-end, and how did you organize releases?"

*Answer*: "I owned the entire stack from database schema design to frontend deployment. For releases, I used feature branches with automated builds, staged environments for testing database migrations, and blue-green deployments to minimize downtime. I implemented semantic versioning with automated changelog generation and used Docker containers for consistent deployments across environments."

## Resume bullet 2
Built a full-stack TypeScript web application with React frontend and Express.js backend, featuring a real-time HTML5 Canvas drawing editor with react-sketch-canvas integration, custom drawing tools, color picker, and brush size controls

**Expanded talking points:**
- **Canvas architecture**: Implemented HTML5 Canvas with react-sketch-canvas for stroke capture, using requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering and Web Workers for intensive path operations
- **Real-time collaboration**: WebSocket connections with Socket.io for bidirectional communication, operational transformation (OT) algorithms for conflict resolution, and event sourcing for audit trails
- **Custom drawing tools**: Built modular tool system with strategy pattern - brush, pen, eraser, shapes - each with configurable properties (opacity, blend modes, pressure sensitivity)
- **State management**: Redux Toolkit for canvas state, Immer for immutable updates, and custom middleware for undo/redo with command pattern implementation
- **Performance optimizations**: Canvas virtualization for large drawings, path simplification algorithms, and selective re-rendering using React.memo and useMemo hooks
- **Data persistence**: Serialized canvas paths to JSON with compression, stored in PostgreSQL with JSONB indexing, and implemented incremental save with debouncing

**Technical lingo to showcase:**
- "Implemented operational transformation with vector clocks for concurrent editing"
- "Used Bézier curve simplification and Douglas-Peucker algorithm for path optimization"
- "Applied canvas context batching and dirty rectangle rendering for 60fps performance"
- "Implemented CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) for distributed canvas state"

**Follow-up answer**: "How did you manage stroke ordering, concurrent edits, and undo across collaborators?"

*Answer*: "I implemented a hybrid operational transformation system where each stroke has a logical timestamp and author ID. For concurrent edits, I used vector clocks to establish causal ordering and applied transformation functions when conflicts occurred. The undo system maintains separate command stacks per user with global ordering via Lamport timestamps. When a user undos, we broadcast the undo operation which other clients apply through inverse transformations while preserving the intention of remaining strokes."

## Resume bullet 3
Engineered a fault-tolerant video processing pipeline using AWS SDK v3, implementing server-side FFmpeg transcoding for cross-format video compatibility (.mov → .mp4), multipart file uploads with 50MB limits, secure S3 bucket storage with presigned URLs

**Expanded talking points:**
- **Upload architecture**: Implemented multipart upload with AWS SDK v3 using presigned URLs, chunked transfer encoding, and resumable uploads with ETag validation for large files
- **FFmpeg transcoding pipeline**: Built asynchronous job queue with Bull/Redis, used fluent-ffmpeg with custom presets for H.264/AAC encoding, and implemented adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS/DASH)
- **Fault tolerance mechanisms**: Circuit breaker pattern for AWS API calls, exponential backoff with jitter, dead letter queues for failed jobs, and comprehensive logging with structured JSON
- **Performance optimizations**: Parallel processing with worker pools, S3 transfer acceleration, CloudFront CDN integration, and GPU-accelerated encoding where available
- **Security implementations**: IAM roles with least privilege, S3 bucket policies with IP restrictions, presigned URL expiration (15min), and content-type validation
- **Monitoring & observability**: CloudWatch metrics, custom dashboards, SNS alerts for failures, and distributed tracing with X-Ray

**Technical lingo to showcase:**
- "Implemented idempotent job processing with database transactions and optimistic locking"
- "Used S3 lifecycle policies for automated tier transition and cost optimization"
- "Applied backpressure mechanisms and graceful degradation for peak load handling"
- "Leveraged AWS Lambda for serverless video thumbnail generation with sharp/jimp"

**Follow-up answer**: "How do you handle job escalation and re-processing for failed transcodes?"

*Answer*: "I implemented a tiered retry system: immediate retry for transient errors (network timeouts), exponential backoff for service errors (rate limiting), and manual escalation for persistent failures. Failed jobs move to a dead letter queue where they're analyzed - corruption issues get flagged for re-upload, while encoding errors trigger alternative codec attempts. I maintain job metadata including failure reasons, retry counts, and processing duration histograms to identify patterns and optimize the pipeline proactively."

## Resume bullet 4
Developed an end-to-end automated captioning system leveraging Amazon Transcribe, implementing audio extraction via FFmpeg, asynchronous job polling, JSON-to-SRT/VTT conversion algorithms, and S3-hosted subtitle delivery with CORS-enabled streaming for accessibility

**Expanded talking points:**
- **Audio processing pipeline**: FFmpeg audio extraction with sample rate normalization (16kHz), noise reduction filters, and channel mixing for optimal speech recognition accuracy
- **AWS Transcribe integration**: Asynchronous job submission with custom vocabularies, speaker diarization, confidence scoring, and webhook/SNS callback handling for job completion
- **Subtitle format conversion**: Implemented WebVTT and SRT parsers with timestamp synchronization, text segmentation based on speech patterns, and compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)
- **Streaming delivery**: S3-hosted subtitle files with CloudFront CDN, CORS configuration for cross-origin requests, and HTTP range request support for large caption files
- **Quality assurance**: Automated validation of subtitle timing, text length per caption, reading speed calculations (150-180 WPM), and overlap detection
- **Multi-language support**: Unicode handling, right-to-left text support, language detection, and batch processing for multiple audio tracks

**Technical lingo to showcase:**
- "Implemented speech recognition confidence thresholding with manual review workflows"
- "Used sliding window algorithms for optimal caption timing and natural break points"
- "Applied text normalization and profanity filtering with configurable sensitivity levels"
- "Leveraged AWS EventBridge for decoupled microservice communication and job orchestration"

**Follow-up answer**: "How do you handle long media (>1hr) or multiple language captions?"

*Answer*: "For long media, I segment audio into 15-minute chunks with 30-second overlaps to maintain context at boundaries. Each segment is processed in parallel through Transcribe, then results are merged using timestamp alignment and confidence scoring to resolve overlaps. For multiple languages, I detect the primary language using Amazon Comprehend, then process each language track separately with language-specific vocabularies. The system supports subtitle track switching in players and maintains synchronization across all language versions using a master timeline reference."
